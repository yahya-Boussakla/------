        <p>In a world inundated with information, true learning often <br> occurs <br>
            when we roll up our sleeves and dive into the task at hand.
            "Learn by Doing" encapsulates the essence of active
            participation in the learning process. Instead of merely 
            absorbing facts and figures, this approach encourages us to 
            engage directly with concepts, theories, and skills.
